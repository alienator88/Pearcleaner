A free, source-available and fair-code licensed mac app cleaner inspired by [Freemacsoft's AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) and [Sun Knudsen's Privacy Guides](https://sunknudsen.com/privacy-guides/how-to-clean-uninstall-macos-apps-using-appcleaner-open-source-alternative) post on his app-cleaner script.
This project was born out of wanting to learn more on how macOS deals with app installation/uninstallation and getting more Swift experience. If you have suggestions I'm open to hearing them, submit a feature request!

- Mini mode which can be enabled from Settings
- Menubar icon option
- One-Shot Mode
- Can drop apps to uninstall directly on the Pearcleaner Dock icon or the app window
- Optional Finder Extension which allows you to uninstall an app directly from Finder by `right click > Pearcleaner Uninstall`

- Has clean uninstall menu option for the Pearcleaner app itself if you want to stop using it and get rid of all files and launch items

- Condition builder to easily include or exclude files from searches when file names don't match the app name/bundle id very well
- Export app file list search results
- Optional Homebrew cleanup
- Include extra directories to search for apps in
- Exclude files/folders from the leftover file search
- Custom auto-updater that pulls latest release notes and binaries from GitHub Releases (Pearcleaner should run from `/Applications` folder to avoid permission issues)
