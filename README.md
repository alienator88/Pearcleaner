A free, source-available and fair-code licensed Mac app cleaner inspired by [Freemacsoft's AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) and [Sun Knudsen's Privacy Guides](https://github.com/sunknudsen/guides/tree/main/archive/how-to-clean-uninstall-macos-apps-using-appcleaner-open-source-alternative) post on his app-cleaner script.
This project was born out of wanting to learn more on how macOS deals with app installation/uninstallation and getting more Swift experience. If you have suggestions I'm open to hearing them, submit a feature request!
