This project is now in **maintenance mode**.

---

I’m no longer accepting **NEW** feature requests as Pearcleaner has grown to be fairly feature rich, 
and I want to avoid it ballooning further in size or scope. Keeping the project stable, focused, and maintainable is now the priority. Going forward, the focus will be on:

- Bug fixes
- Regressions
- Small improvements to already existing features

Issues related to bugs are still welcome, and reasonable pull requests that focus on fixes or reliability 
improvements will still be reviewed. New feature requests will be ignored/closed if submitted.

Thanks to everyone who has used the project, filed issues, and contributed over time!
