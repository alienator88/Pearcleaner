This project is now in **maintenance mode**.

---

I’m no longer accepting new feature requests as Pearcleaner has grown to be fairly feature rich, 
and I want to avoid it ballooning further in size or scope. Keeping the project stable, focused, and maintainable 
is now the priority. Going forward, the focus will be on:

- Bug fixes
- Regressions

Issues related to bugs are still welcome, and reasonable pull requests that focus on fixes or reliability 
improvements will still be reviewed. Feature requests will be ignored/closed if submitted.

Thanks to everyone who has used the project, filed issues, and contributed over time!
